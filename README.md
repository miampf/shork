# Shork ðŸ¦ˆ

A fishy try on interpreted programming languages and a tribute to the all loved IKEA shorki. Meant to be for easy developement of PoC exploits, but feel free to use it however you want (this also means that I am not responsible for ANYTHING you make with this!)

## What works atm?

Nothing because I didn't start coding yet.

## Learn to wield the power of the shonk

To learn the language specs, feel free to take a look at the [docs](docs/Intro.md)! Code examples are in the ```shork-examples``` folder, although some features they use may not work because I havent implemented them yet. To know which features work, visit the [What works atm?](#what-works-atm) section above.
