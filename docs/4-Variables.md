# Variables

```Doesn't work rn```

Variables can easily be declared by writing ```varname = varvalue```, or ```varname: vartype = varvalue```. The type of a variable is fixed upon initialisation, so you cannot assign a string to a variable that holds a float. A list of native variable types can be seen below:

| Type    | Description                                       |
| integer | A simple, whole number                            |
| long    | A larger whole number                             |
| float   | A floating point number                           |
| double  | Also a floating point number, but more precise.   |
| char    | holds a single character. Uses only single quotes |
| string  | holds a string of characters. Uses double quotes  |
